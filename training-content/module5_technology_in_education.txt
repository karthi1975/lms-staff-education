Module 5: Technology in Education

Introduction to Educational Technology
Technology has transformed education, offering new tools for instruction, collaboration, assessment, and personalized learning. Effective technology integration enhances learning outcomes, engages students, and prepares them for a digital world. However, technology should serve pedagogical goals, not replace good teaching. This module explores frameworks for technology integration, digital tools for instruction and assessment, online and hybrid learning, digital citizenship, and equitable access.

Frameworks for Technology Integration

SAMR Model
The SAMR model, developed by Dr. Ruben Puentedura, describes four levels of technology integration:

Substitution
Technology acts as a direct substitute with no functional change.
Example: Using a word processor instead of handwriting an essay.

Augmentation
Technology acts as a substitute with functional improvement.
Example: Using a word processor with spell-check, thesaurus, and formatting tools.

Modification
Technology allows significant task redesign.
Example: Students collaboratively write and edit a document in real-time using Google Docs, providing peer feedback through comments.

Redefinition
Technology allows creation of new tasks previously inconceivable.
Example: Students create a multimedia digital story with embedded video, audio, and interactive elements, then share it with a global audience for feedback.

The goal is to move toward Modification and Redefinition, where technology transforms learning.

TPACK Framework
The TPACK (Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge) framework identifies three types of knowledge teachers need:

Content Knowledge (CK)
Understanding of the subject matter being taught.

Pedagogical Knowledge (PK)
Understanding of teaching methods and strategies.

Technological Knowledge (TK)
Understanding of various technologies and how to use them.

Effective teaching occurs at the intersection of these three areas:
- Technological Content Knowledge (TCK): How technology represents content
- Technological Pedagogical Knowledge (TPK): How technology changes teaching methods
- Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK): How to teach specific content effectively
- TPACK: Integration of all three for effective technology-enhanced instruction

Triple E Framework
The Triple E Framework evaluates technology's effectiveness by asking:

Engage
Does the technology help students focus on learning tasks and assignments?

Enhance
Does the technology enhance learning in ways that couldn't be accomplished without it?

Extend
Does the technology allow students to extend learning beyond the classroom?

Technology should meet at least one E, ideally all three, to be worthwhile.
