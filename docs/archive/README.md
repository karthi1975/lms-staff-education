# Archived Development Files

This directory contains files from the development process that are no longer needed in the main project directory but are preserved for reference.

## Directory Structure

- **session-notes/** - Development session documentation, fixes, and guides
- **research/** - Model comparison research and evaluation results
- **test-scripts/** - Test and debug scripts used during development
- **temp-files/** - Temporary or experimental files

## Notes

These files document the development journey and can be useful for:
- Understanding past design decisions
- Troubleshooting similar issues in the future
- Reference for architecture evolution
- Historical context for new developers

All functionality from these documents is now integrated into the main codebase and documented in the root README.md and SETUP.md files.
