# Delete Course Feature - Implementation Complete

## ✅ Feature Added

### UI: Delete Button on Course Cards

**Location**: Admin Dashboard → Courses Tab

Each course card now has a **🗑️ Delete** button that:
1. Shows double confirmation dialogs
2. Deletes course from all systems
3. Refreshes the course list

**Button Style**: Red danger button with hover effect

---

## 🔧 What Gets Deleted

When you click **Delete** on a course, the system removes:

### 1. PostgreSQL Database ✅
- Course record
- All modules
- All quizzes
- All quiz questions
- All content chunks

### 2. Neo4j Graph ✅
- Course node
- All module nodes
- All content nodes
- All relationships

### 3. ChromaDB Vectors ⚠️
- Content chunk embeddings (noted for manual cleanup)
- *Note: Automatic deletion not yet implemented*

---

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Double Confirmation
1. **First Dialog**: Explains what will be deleted
   ```
   ⚠️ DELETE COURSE: "Teacher Training Courses"?

   This will permanently delete:
   ✗ All modules
   ✗ All quizzes and questions
   ✗ All content chunks
   ✗ Neo4j graph data
   ✗ ChromaDB vectors

   This action CANNOT be undone!
   ```

2. **Second Dialog**: Final confirmation
   ```
   Are you absolutely sure you want to delete "Teacher Training Courses"?

   Type the course name to confirm (or click Cancel).
   ```

### Cascading Deletes
- Automatic deletion of all related data
- Proper order (questions → quizzes → modules → course)
- No orphaned data left behind

---

## 📋 Deletion Process

### Step 1: Get Course Info
```javascript
SELECT * FROM moodle_courses WHERE id = :courseId
```

### Step 2: Delete from Neo4j
```cypher
// Delete course node
MATCH (c:Course {moodleId: :moodleCourseId})
DETACH DELETE c

// Clean up orphaned modules
MATCH (m:Module)
WHERE NOT EXISTS((m)<-[:HAS_MODULE]-(:Course))
DETACH DELETE m
```

### Step 3: Delete from ChromaDB (Noted)
```javascript
// Get chunk IDs
SELECT chroma_id FROM module_content_chunks
WHERE module_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM moodle_modules WHERE course_id = :courseId
)

// Note: Manual cleanup required or restart ChromaDB container
```

### Step 4: Delete from PostgreSQL
```sql
-- Delete quiz questions
DELETE FROM quiz_questions
WHERE moodle_quiz_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM moodle_quizzes WHERE course_id = :courseId
);

-- Delete content chunks
DELETE FROM module_content_chunks
WHERE module_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM moodle_modules WHERE course_id = :courseId
);

-- Delete quizzes
DELETE FROM moodle_quizzes WHERE course_id = :courseId;

-- Delete modules
DELETE FROM moodle_modules WHERE course_id = :courseId;

-- Delete course
DELETE FROM moodle_courses WHERE id = :courseId;
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Delete button doesn't work
**Check**: JavaScript console for errors
```bash
# Browser console (F12)
# Look for network errors or authentication issues
```

### Issue: Data still showing after delete
**Solution**: Refresh the page
```bash
# Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
```

### Issue: "Course not found" error
**Check**: Course ID is valid
```sql
SELECT id, course_name FROM moodle_courses;
```

### Issue: ChromaDB vectors remain
**Solution**: Restart ChromaDB container
```bash
docker restart teachers_training-chromadb-1
```

### Issue: Neo4j nodes remain
**Solution**: Manual cleanup
```cypher
// Check orphaned nodes
MATCH (n)
WHERE NOT EXISTS((n)<--())
RETURN labels(n), count(n);

// Delete all course data
MATCH (c:Course) DETACH DELETE c;
MATCH (m:Module) DETACH DELETE m;
```
