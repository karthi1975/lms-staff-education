## 🎯 Chart 5: Cost-Effectiveness (Horizontal Bar Chart)

### What It Shows:
Quality points per dollar (Quality Score ÷ Cost)
**Higher = Better value**

### Results:
```
Llama-4:       1,238  🏆 Best Value!
Gemini 2.5:      966  (22% less value)
Claude 3.5:       29  (43x less value!)
```

### Calculation Example:
- **Llama:** 85.2% quality ÷ $0.0688 = 1,238 points per dollar
- **Claude:** 88% quality ÷ $3.00 = 29 points per dollar

### Key Insight:
- **Llama is 43x more cost-effective** than Claude
- Despite lower quality (85% vs 88%), Llama's low cost makes it best value
- **This is the most important metric** for high-volume RAG systems

### Winner Badge:
🏆 "Best Value" label on Llama bar

- **Latency:** <3s is good, <2s is excellent
- **Value Score:** Higher is dramatically better

---

## 📋 DECISION GUIDE BASED ON GRAPHS

### Choose Llama-4 if:
- ✅ Running high-volume RAG system (10k+ requests/day)
- ✅ Cost is a concern (saves $29k/year vs Claude)
- ✅ Speed matters (WhatsApp, chat interfaces)
- ✅ Need detailed responses (258 words vs 40 for Gemini)
- ✅ **This is 95% of use cases**

### Choose Claude 3.5 if:
- ✅ Budget unlimited ($30k+/year acceptable)
- ✅ Absolute best quality required (88% vs 85%)
- ✅ Low volume (<100k requests/year)
- ✅ Premium positioning important
- ✅ 3% quality improvement worth 43x cost

### Choose Gemini 2.5 if:
- ❌ **NOT RECOMMENDED**
- Truncation issues make it unsuitable
- Only wins on distance (6,500km from Tanzania)
- 72% quality too low for educational content

---

## 📊 GRAPH INTERPRETATION TIPS

### Look for:
1. **Bar Height Differences:** Dramatic differences = important
2. **Radar Chart Shape:** Balanced = consistent quality
3. **Cost Bar:** Exponential scale - small differences = huge $$$
4. **Checkmarks in Scorecard:** Count winners per model

### Red Flags:
- ⚠️ Gemini's small radar shape (weak completeness)
- ⚠️ Claude's towering cost bar (prohibitive)
- ⚠️ Gemini's latency bar (too slow)

### Green Lights:
- ✅ Llama's value score (1,238 - outstanding)
- ✅ Llama's cost bar (barely visible - great!)
- ✅ Claude's quality radar (balanced excellence)

---

## 🎯 BOTTOM LINE FROM GRAPHS

The graphs clearly show:

1. **Quality:** Claude wins (88%) but Llama close (85%)
2. **Cost:** Llama wins (43x cheaper than Claude)
3. **Speed:** Llama wins (2.4x faster than Gemini)
4. **Value:** Llama wins (1,238 vs 29 for Claude)

**Recommendation visible in all charts:**
**Llama-4 is the clear winner** for educational RAG systems.

Only choose Claude if cost is no object and you need that extra 3% quality.
