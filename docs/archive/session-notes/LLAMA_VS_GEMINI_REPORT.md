## 💡 Alternative: Test Gemini in Mumbai

If you still want Gemini, consider **Mumbai (asia-south1)**:
- Only 4,200 km from Tanzania (65% closer than us-east5)
- Similar latency to Belgium (~5.5s)
- Same cost ($0.0648/1k)
- BUT: Only 40% success rate (availability issues)

---

## 📝 Final Verdict

### **Recommendation: KEEP Llama-4 (us-east5)**

**Trade-offs accepted:**
- ✅ Keep 2.4x faster response time
- ✅ Keep 8% cost savings
- ✅ Keep verbose educational responses
- ❌ Accept 12,000 km distance (proven to work fine)
- ❌ No reasoning tokens (but works well for RAG)

**If latency is not critical**, Gemini is worth testing in production. But **for best user experience, Llama wins**.
