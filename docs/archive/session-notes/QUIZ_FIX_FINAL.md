# Quiz Questions Fix

## Date: 2025-10-07

## Issue
WhatsApp quiz was showing incorrect questions (teaching/assessment questions) instead of entrepreneurship questions from the Moodle quiz.

## Root Cause
The `quiz_questions` table contained wrong questions that didn't match the Moodle "Enterprise Business Quizz" (ID 4).

## Fix Applied

### 1. Deleted Incorrect Questions
```sql
DELETE FROM quiz_questions WHERE moodle_quiz_id = 1;
```

### 2. Inserted Correct Entrepreneurship Questions
Added 4 questions matching the Moodle quiz:

1. **What is entrepreneurship?** (Multiple Choice)
   - Avoiding risk in any economic activity
   - Buying goods for personal use only
   - **The process of creating and managing a venture to solve problems or meet needs with value and risk** ✓
   - Government ownership of all businesses

2. **Which is NOT typically a characteristic of an entrepreneur?** (Multiple Choice)
   - **Avoiding all forms of risk** ✓
   - Creativity
   - Perseverance
   - Initiative

3. **What does feasibility mean in business idea evaluation?** (Multiple Choice)
   - **Practicality and achievability of the business idea** ✓
   - A legal business name
   - Only focusing on profits
   - A government policy

4. **True or False: Entrepreneurship always requires starting a completely new company from scratch.** (True/False)
   - True
   - **False** ✓

### 3. Module Mapping
- Module ID: 2 (`Entrepreneurship & Business Ideas`)
- Moodle Quiz ID: 1
- Moodle External Quiz ID: 4

### 4. Database Update
```sql
INSERT INTO quiz_questions (module_id, moodle_quiz_id, question_text, question_type, options, correct_answer, sequence_order)
VALUES (2, 1, 'What is entrepreneurship?', 'multiple_choice', [...], 'correct answer', 1);
-- ... 3 more questions
```

## Testing

### WhatsApp Quiz Flow
1. User: "quiz please"
2. Bot: Shows "What is entrepreneurship?" with 4 options (A/B/C/D)
3. User: Clicks correct answer
4. Bot: Moves to next question
5. Bot: Continues through all 4 questions
6. Bot: Shows quiz results + certificate (if passed)

### Expected Behavior
- ✅ Questions match Moodle quiz
- ✅ Options display correctly
- ✅ Correct answers are validated
- ✅ Moodle sync uses quiz ID 4
- ✅ Results recorded properly

## Moodle Integration

### Enrolled User
- **Name**: Test Student
- **Email**: test@student.edu.invalid
- **Role**: Student
- **Enrolled in**: Business Studies → Entrepreneurship & Business Ideas → Enterprise Business Quizz

### WhatsApp User Mapping
The WhatsApp phone number is linked to this Moodle user for quiz result synchronization.

## Files Modified
- PostgreSQL `quiz_questions` table
- No code changes required (data fix only)

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Quiz now shows correct entrepreneurship questions matching Moodle quiz.

## Next Steps
1. Test quiz in WhatsApp
2. Verify all 4 questions display correctly
3. Confirm Moodle sync works with enrolled user
4. Verify certificate generation works

**Note**: The chat functionality was already working correctly with RAG responses. Only the quiz questions needed to be corrected.
