# Knowledge Graph for Context Reasoning in Teachers Training System

## Overview
Knowledge graphs enhance context reasoning by creating a structured, interconnected representation of learning data that enables intelligent decision-making and personalized experiences.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Entity Modeling & Relationships
Knowledge graphs represent entities as nodes and relationships as edges:

```cypher
// Core Entities
(:User) - Person taking the training
(:Module) - Learning module (e.g., "Classroom Management")
(:Concept) - Specific concept within a module
(:Quiz) - Assessment for a module
(:Content) - Learning material (documents, videos)
(:Session) - User learning session
(:Interaction) - User interaction with system

// Key Relationships
(:User)-[:ENROLLED_IN]->(:Module)
(:User)-[:COMPLETED]->(:Module)
(:Module)-[:PREREQUISITE_FOR]->(:Module)
(:Module)-[:CONTAINS]->(:Concept)
(:User)-[:STRUGGLED_WITH]->(:Concept)
(:Quiz)-[:TESTS]->(:Concept)
(:User)-[:VIEWED]->(:Content)
(:Content)-[:TEACHES]->(:Concept)
```

### Step 2: Context Building Through Graph Traversal

#### A. Learning Path Context
```cypher
// Get user's complete learning context
MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})
OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[p:PROGRESS]->(m:Module)
OPTIONAL MATCH (m)-[:PREREQUISITE_FOR]->(next:Module)
OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[quiz:TOOK_QUIZ]->(q:Quiz)-[:FOR_MODULE]->(m)
RETURN u, m, p, next, quiz
```

This provides:
- Current module progress
- Prerequisites completed
- Next available modules
- Quiz performance history

#### B. Concept Mastery Context
```cypher
// Identify concepts user has mastered vs struggling
MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})-[:TOOK_QUIZ]->(q:Quiz)
MATCH (q)-[:HAS_QUESTION]->(question:Question)-[:TESTS]->(c:Concept)
WITH u, c, 
     collect(question.correct) as attempts,
     count(question) as total_attempts
RETURN c.name as concept,
       sum(CASE WHEN question.correct THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / total_attempts as mastery_level
ORDER BY mastery_level
```

### Step 3: Multi-Hop Reasoning for Recommendations

#### A. Content Recommendation Based on Peer Success
```cypher
// Find content that helped similar users succeed
MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})-[:STRUGGLED_WITH]->(c:Concept)
MATCH (other:User)-[:MASTERED]->(c)
WHERE other.id <> $userId
MATCH (other)-[:VIEWED]->(content:Content)-[:TEACHES]->(c)
MATCH (other)-[:TOOK_QUIZ]->(q:Quiz)-[:TESTS]->(c)
WHERE q.score > 0.8
RETURN content, count(DISTINCT other) as success_count
ORDER BY success_count DESC
LIMIT 5
```

#### B. Learning Path Optimization
```cypher
// Find optimal learning sequence based on dependency graph
MATCH path = (start:Module {id: $currentModule})-[:PREREQUISITE_FOR*1..3]->(end:Module)
WHERE NOT exists((end)-[:PREREQUISITE_FOR]->(:Module))
WITH path, 
     reduce(difficulty = 0, m IN nodes(path) | difficulty + m.difficulty) as total_difficulty,
     reduce(time = 0, m IN nodes(path) | time + m.estimated_time) as total_time
RETURN path, total_difficulty, total_time
ORDER BY total_difficulty ASC
LIMIT 3
```

### Step 4: Pattern Recognition for Coaching

#### A. Identify Learning Patterns
```cypher
// Detect users who follow similar learning patterns
MATCH (u1:User {id: $userId})-[:PROGRESS]->(m:Module)
WITH u1, collect(m.id) as u1_modules
MATCH (u2:User)-[:PROGRESS]->(m2:Module)
WHERE u2.id <> u1.id
WITH u1, u1_modules, u2, collect(m2.id) as u2_modules
WHERE size([x IN u1_modules WHERE x IN u2_modules]) > size(u1_modules) * 0.7
RETURN u2 as similar_user, u2_modules
```

#### B. Predict Struggle Points
```cypher
// Predict concepts user might struggle with
MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})
MATCH (similar:User)-[:STRUGGLED_WITH]->(c:Concept)
WHERE exists((similar)-[:SIMILAR_TO]->(u))
AND NOT exists((u)-[:VIEWED_CONTENT_FOR]->(c))
RETURN c, count(similar) as struggle_probability
ORDER BY struggle_probability DESC
```

### Step 5: Temporal Context Reasoning

#### A. Learning Velocity Analysis
```cypher
// Calculate learning speed and predict completion time
MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})-[p:PROGRESS]->(m:Module)
WITH u, m, p, 
     duration.between(p.started_at, p.last_accessed).days as days_spent,
     p.completion_percentage as progress
WHERE progress > 0
WITH u, avg(progress / days_spent) as avg_velocity
MATCH (remaining:Module)
WHERE NOT exists((u)-[:COMPLETED]->(remaining))
RETURN remaining, remaining.estimated_time / avg_velocity as predicted_days
```

#### B. Engagement Pattern Detection
```cypher
// Identify engagement patterns for nudging
MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})-[s:SESSION]->(m:Module)
WITH u, m, s.timestamp as session_time
ORDER BY session_time
WITH u, m, collect(session_time) as sessions,
     collect(duration.between(session_time, datetime()).hours) as hours_between
RETURN u, m,
       CASE 
         WHEN avg(hours_between) < 24 THEN 'highly_engaged'
         WHEN avg(hours_between) < 72 THEN 'moderately_engaged'
         ELSE 'needs_nudge'
       END as engagement_level
```

### Step 6: Contextual Query Enhancement

#### A. RAG Context Enrichment
```javascript
async function enrichRAGContext(userId, query) {
  // 1. Get user's knowledge graph context
  const graphContext = await neo4j.run(`
    MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})-[:PROGRESS]->(m:Module)
    MATCH (m)-[:CONTAINS]->(c:Concept)
    OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[:STRUGGLED_WITH]->(struggle:Concept)
    RETURN m, collect(DISTINCT c) as concepts, 
           collect(DISTINCT struggle) as struggles
  `, {userId});

  // 2. Enhance ChromaDB query with graph context
  const enhancedQuery = {
    original: query,
    must_include: graphContext.concepts,
    boost_if_addresses: graphContext.struggles,
    user_level: graphContext.module.difficulty
  };

  // 3. Get personalized content
  return await chromaService.searchWithContext(enhancedQuery);
}
```

#### B. Response Personalization
```javascript
async function personalizeResponse(userId, baseResponse) {
  // Get user's learning style from graph
  const style = await neo4j.run(`
    MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})-[:PREFERS]->(s:Style)
    RETURN s.type as style
  `, {userId});

  // Get user's mastery level
  const mastery = await neo4j.run(`
    MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})-[m:MASTERED]->(c:Concept)
    RETURN avg(m.level) as avg_mastery
  `, {userId});

  // Adjust response based on context
  if (style === 'visual') {
    baseResponse = addVisualExamples(baseResponse);
  }
  
  if (mastery < 0.5) {
    baseResponse = simplifyLanguage(baseResponse);
  }

  return baseResponse;
}
```

### Step 7: Intelligent Decision Making

#### A. Next Best Action
```cypher
// Determine next best action for user
MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})
OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[:PROGRESS]->(current:Module)
OPTIONAL MATCH (u)-[:LAST_QUIZ]->(q:Quiz)
WITH u, current, q,
     CASE
       WHEN current.completion_percentage > 80 AND q IS NULL THEN 'take_quiz'
       WHEN q.score < 0.7 THEN 'review_content'
       WHEN current.completion_percentage < 50 THEN 'continue_learning'
       ELSE 'advance_module'
     END as next_action
RETURN next_action, current
```

#### B. Adaptive Difficulty
```cypher
// Adjust content difficulty based on performance
MATCH (u:User {id: $userId})-[:TOOK_QUIZ]->(q:Quiz)
WITH u, avg(q.score) as avg_score,
     CASE
       WHEN avg(q.score) > 0.9 THEN 'increase'
       WHEN avg(q.score) < 0.6 THEN 'decrease'
       ELSE 'maintain'
     END as difficulty_adjustment
MATCH (next:Module)
WHERE next.difficulty = CASE difficulty_adjustment
  WHEN 'increase' THEN u.current_difficulty + 1
  WHEN 'decrease' THEN u.current_difficulty - 1
  ELSE u.current_difficulty
END
RETURN next
```

5. Include review questions for struggled concepts

### Use Case 3: Learning Path Optimization
For course progression:
1. Calculate shortest path through prerequisites
2. Consider user's learning velocity
3. Account for concept dependencies
4. Suggest alternative paths based on strengths
5. Predict realistic completion timeline

## Integration with RAG Pipeline

```javascript
class EnhancedRAGService {
  async processQuery(userId, query, sessionId) {
    // 1. Get graph context
    const graphContext = await this.getGraphContext(userId);
    
    // 2. Enhance query with context
    const enhancedQuery = this.enhanceQuery(query, graphContext);
    
    // 3. Search ChromaDB with context
    const documents = await chromaService.contextualSearch(enhancedQuery);
    
    // 4. Generate response with Vertex AI
    const response = await vertexAI.generate({
      query: query,
      context: documents,
      user_context: graphContext,
      personalization: graphContext.learning_style
    });
    
    // 5. Update graph with interaction
    await this.updateGraph(userId, query, response);
    
    return response;
  }
}
```

## Conclusion

Knowledge graphs transform flat data into rich, contextual information that enables:
- **Deeper Understanding**: Of user's learning journey
- **Better Predictions**: Of future performance and needs
- **Smarter Recommendations**: Based on patterns and relationships
- **Adaptive Learning**: That evolves with the user
- **Contextual Responses**: That consider the full learning context

The graph structure naturally represents the interconnected nature of learning, making it ideal for educational systems that need to reason about complex relationships and provide personalized experiences.
